BDBI: Ace Food Pantry Deliverable

	Goal of the project: Create a system that allows Ace Food Pantry to record donations and withdrawals through an easy to use application. 

Detailed description: At the beginning of the project we planned on creating a local application using GUIs that allowed the user to withdrawal and deposit items using a text file that would store all of the Pantry’s food data. However, as we began to develop the program we realized that the program would really only be useful with a computer, and seeing that most Pantry workers logged transactions on their phone we figured it would be best to move in a different direction. We then decided to create a web based application that could be accessed on pantry member’s phones, allowing for a quick and mobile way to log withdrawals and deposits. We started off by developing the backend python that would (insert Caroline commentary here). We also decided to use a database that could communicate with our python program, and remotely store the food items and their values. Finally we created the front end portion of the website that would incorporate the Pantry’s point system for pantry withdrawal, while also serving as the hub for donations and withdrawals for the inventory system as a whole.
